# vxtwitter-android
vxtwitter-android is a simple Android app project named Linkfix that replaces all Twitter links with c.vxtwitter for easy sharing of Twitter links.
I made this because while I've already made a script for Windows, it always bothered me that I don't have similar functionality on Android, but now I do. Yes, it's a lot of spaghetti code but it works. Only partial code is included in this repository, as the rest is untouched and can be recreated using a basic template in Android Studio. Compiled using SDK for Android 12.
